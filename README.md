# Firebase Database Asynchronous Initialization Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the Firebase Realtime Database: attempting to access a database reference before it has fully initialized. This can lead to unexpected errors and crashes in your application.

## Problem
The Firebase Realtime Database is initialized asynchronously. If you try to perform a read or write operation before the initialization is complete, the SDK will throw an error because the reference isn't yet ready.  This often occurs if you try to access the database directly within the onCreate() method of your Activity.

## Solution
The solution involves using listeners or callbacks to ensure the database is initialized before performing any operations. This ensures that the database reference is available and ready to interact with.
